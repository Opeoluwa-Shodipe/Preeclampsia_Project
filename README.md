# Preeclampsia_Project
The primary goal of this project is to use transcriptomics data from placental tissue to identify a sex-specific disease signature in late-onset preeclampsia (PE) and use a large-scale drug perturbation database (TAHOE-100M) to propose existing, safe-for-pregnancy drugs for repurposing.

Hypothesis: The gene expression changes observed in male-bearing placentas with preeclampsia can be reversed by FDA-approved drugs that are generally considered safe during pregnancy, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway.
